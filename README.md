# Applied-Machine-Learning-Project-2021

## Instructions
* The algorithm and get the result you must run the **project.py**.
  * Before running project.py it requires **filling the Csv_Data folder with valid data**.
  * To fill the folder we created a Colab Notebook, that takes image data from Kaggle API and performs pre-processing on the data.
  * The link is located below or here: 
    * [![Open Pre-Process Notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/157g4Gju2nhtRn-tOSIiTjFrhU8cq8_Sj?usp=sharing)
    * We have taken 5 large datasets from Kaggle API which were pre-processed to 10 different datasets (the other 10 datasets were taken from Keras API).   
  * After all of the pre-process is completed you can **run the project.py**.
